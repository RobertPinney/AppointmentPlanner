Created in React and as part of the Codecademy course to become a full-stack engineer.
This project comes after learning about routing in react, although ironically is not a necessary skill to complete it.

The purpose of this app is to allow the user(s) to fill in their contact information and to schedual appointments. As this
project is built entirely in front-end it does not save any information. At a later date it could be useful to build the 
backend especially for learning purposes.

This is the first React project I have completed with minimal outside influence, and although it went painfully slow I was
able to work out every issue on my own.
